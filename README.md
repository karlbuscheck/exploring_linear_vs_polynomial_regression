# exploring_linear_vs_polynomial_regression
An exploration of overfitting with linear and polynomial regression. This project dives into Scikit-learn’s Pipeline and GridSearchCV to explore the trade-off between model complexity and accuracy. As we’ll see, complexity doesn’t always lead to power — sometimes, it introduces noise, variance, and chaos.
